(In a prominent position to one side stands a traditional Chorus of four narrators. If possible these four speak together as one. If not, lines can be spoken by individuals.) Chorus ~ Welcome, good people, one and all, to our little piece Of theatre which tells a tragic tale from Ancient Greece. So seat yourselves and try to stifle snore, sneeze and cough, And please ensure that all your mobile phones have been switched off! Lets begin atop a mountain, Olympus to be precise, Where the gods and goddesses chilled out  twas paradise. But something was amiss up here, things werent serene and calm. Three feisty girls were threatening to do each other harm. (Enter Zeus, followed by Hera, Athene and Aphrodite - looking decidedly angry - and a group of other worried gods and goddesses.) Zeus ~ Now come on Ladies, all this squabblings a real pain, And I mean that quite literally, Im getting a migraine. Each of you is lovely in your own particular way, But who is most drop-dead gorgeous? None of us dare say. Hera ~ Then, Husband Dear, may I suggest you find a bloke that does Have the guts to choose the fairest from the three of us. Aphrodite ~ With my great looks its obvious Ive got this in the bag. Please, lets just get on with it. Waitings such a drag! Athene ~ Excuse me, but this result is no forgone conclusion. Finding an impartial judge is the only real solution. Gods ~ Okay, we know a fella, so belt up for goodness sake! Just stop your caterwauling please, and give our ears a break! (Enter Paris. The cast wolf whistles.) Chorus ~ So they summoned Mr Cool  Paris, Prince of Troy, A big hit with the ladies - a truly handsome boy. Paris ~ Cmon then girls, do your thing, Im here to be impressed. What is it that makes each of you better than the rest?
